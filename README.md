**React web app to find the fewest streaming services needed to access all film/tv content requested by the user.**

Utilizes TMDB's (The Movie Database) API to gather relevant data.

This is then processed in line with solutions to the 'set cover optimization problem' (NP-hard) to find the optimal spread of streaming services.

Current State: 
> Form to take user's search terms ✓
> API calls to get film/show basic details ✓
> Search results are selectable and added to selected content ✓

WIP:
> Implementing a solution to the set cover task
> Hiding content to tidy the UI
